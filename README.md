# dungeon-frog
This is going to be a game about a frog looking for catholic people in a dungeon with rainbows and unicorns.

## Disclaimer
The game is in very early development. Please keep that in mind when you using the software.

## How to compile and run the game
The JAR containing the game can be created by typing:
``mvn install``

This creates a jar in the target folder named ``dungeonfrog-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar``.
 
Then *simply* type ``java -cp target\dungeonfrog-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`` and the game will start.
